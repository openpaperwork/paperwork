# Paperwork installation on GNU/Linux Debian or GNU/Linux Ubuntu


## Package

Currently, there is no official Debian or Ubuntu package for Paperwork.


## Build dependencies

    $ sudo apt install python3-pip python3-setuptools
    $ sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pil

    # PyEnchant dependency
    $ sudo apt install libenchant-dev

    # Not a build dependency, but recommended anyway
    $ sudo apt install python3-whoosh


## System-wide installation

(this is the recommended method by default)

You can then install paperwork using pip:

    $ sudo pip3 install paperwork

Some dependencies cannot be installed automatically, because they depend on
your language. You can find all the required dependencies not yet installed by
running 'paperwork-chkdeps'

    $ paperwork-shell chkdeps paperwork_backend
    $ paperwork-shell chkdeps paperwork

Since Paperwork 1.2, you can add a Paperwork shortcut in your desktop menus
with the following command:

    $ paperwork-shell install


## Install through packages generated by python-stdeb

If you're reluctant to install system wide python libraries through pip,
you can also use debian packages generated on the fly by [python-stdeb](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb)

However, Debian doesn't provide yet the command ```pypi-install``` for Python 3.
Therefore it has first to be installed .. manually.

    $ sudo apt install python3-all-dev python3-pip
    $ sudo apt install python3-{pyocr,enchant,levenshtein,natsort,pycountry,termcolor}
    $ sudo pip3 install stdeb

Then you can generate and install the packages for Paperwork libraires:

    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/pypi-install --release 1.3.7 nose
    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/pypi-install pyinsane2
    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/pypi-install pypillowfight
    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/pypi-install simplebayes

And then you can generate and install the packages for Paperwork itself:

    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/pypi-install paperwork-backend
    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/pypi-install paperwork

Finally, you have to run the following commands to check some extra dependencies:

    $ paperwork-shell chkdeps paperwork_backend
    $ paperwork-shell chkdeps paperwork

And the menu entry:

    $ paperwork-shell install


## Running Paperwork

If you used "paperwork-shell install", a shortcut should be available in the
menus of your window manager (you may have to log out first).

You can also start Paperwork by running the command 'paperwork'.

Enjoy :-)
