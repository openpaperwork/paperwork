2017/08/26 - 1.2.1:
- Add source code of Windows installer (NSIS installer) generator
- Scanner support / Multi-scan: Cancel also successful scan session. Otherwise
  some scanner won't allow new scan sessions later.
- Remove gi version warnings when starting (thanks to Matthieu Coudron)
- Documentation: Add missing stdeb dependencies (thanks to Notkea)
- paperwork-shell: Fix command 'scan'
- paperwork-shell install: add docstring
- Fix dialog 'about'

2017/07/11 - 1.2.0:
- Installation: A new command has been added: "paperwork-shell install".
  This command installs icons and shortcut in the desktop menus.
- Add integrated documentations:
  + Introduction to Paperwork (added to the documents when Paperworks starts
    for the first time)
  + User manual (not complete yet)
  + Developer's guide
  + Translator's guide
- Text in pages can be selected
- Text in pages can be copied in clipboard
- Automatically look for updates (disabled by default ; see settings)
- Send anonymous usage statistics (disabled by default ; see settings)
- Export: Add simplification methods 'grayscale', 'black and white', and
  'grayscale + soft'. They produce much smaller documents
- setup.py: Properly package resources files (glade, images, css) and load them
  using pkg_resources. (thanks to Alexandre Vaissière)
- Import: After import, propose the user to move files to trash after import
  (thanks to Mathieu Schopfer)
- Import: Allow selecting multiple files in the file chooser dialog
- Import: Clearly show in the file chooser dialog which file formats are
  supported
- Import: Use notifications instead of popups
- Virtualenv: also look for translation files (thanks to Alexandre Vaissière)
- Export: Remove the text field + save button ; request the target file
  location when the user actually clicks on 'export'
- Export: Display a notification when exports are finished
- Search: When searching, display a search bar to browse the document(s)
- Search: new keyboard shortcuts: F3 (next) + Shift+F3 (previous)
- Settings: Remove "Disable OCR" from the language list. It's redundant with
  the check box above the language list
- non-Gnome / non-Unity environements : Move the application menu to the left
  headerbar (top left of the main window)
- paperwork-shell chkdeps: look for libsane too
- localize.sh: Also include the translations for paperwork-backend
- Settings: Use pycountry to translate the language names + remove 'equ'
  and 'osd'
- GUI: change the way left panes are switched to reduce issues with GTK+
- Internal: Switch everything to URIs (required for correct Gio use)
- Devel: Add basic command line arguments (thanks to Mathieu
  Coudron):
  + -d for debug output
  + -v for version

2017/02/09 - 1.1.2:
- Doc date changing: Fix for Windows: Don't display the document while
  renaming its folder --> it keeps a file descriptor opened to its PDF
  file and prevent the renaming

2017/02/05 - 1.1.1:
- Fix document list refresh problem (mostly visible on Ubuntu)

2017/01/30 - 1.1.0:
- Windows: Activation mechanism has been disabled for now
- Workarounds for Gtk-3.20.x / GLib 2.50 (Ubuntu):
  - Work around weird behavior of GLib.idle_add (multiple calls)
  - Work around lack of refresh of document list
- Import: Display how many image files, PDFs, documents and pages have been
  imported.
- Automatic Color Equalization: Reduce the 'circle side-effect' by increasing
  the number of samples used.
- paperwork-shell scan: Quit after scanning
- Settings window: "Source" becomes "Default source" (cosmetic)
- Export: Don't lock the UI
- Export: Display the progression of the export
- Improve keyword highlighting: Highlight words identical to search keywords
  (as before) and also words close enough (example: 'flesh' when 'flesch'
  is being search)
- Optim: Document list: Only display display the first 100 elements of the
  list, and extend it only when required. Reduces GTK latency
  (GtkListBox doesn't scale very well above 100 elements).
- Optim: Improve PDF rendering speed: Let the libpoppler take care of the
  rendering size (see backend:page.get_image())
- Optim: Reduce the number of useless calls to redraw()

2016/12/04 - 1.0.6:
- Diagnostic: Limit the number of lines kept in memory (avoid running out of
  memory in case of endless loop)
- Diagnostic: Log all the uncatched exceptions

  import
- Multiple document selection: Fix the way Ctrl/Shift keys are handled (bug
  was that multiple selection mode remained stuck sometimes)

2016/11/22 - 1.0.5:
- Setting the resolution on the scanner may not actually work. If it is not
  possible to set the resolution, fall back on the current one.

  if pyinsane2.maximize_scan_area() fails

  correctly


2015/01/11 - 0.2.2:
